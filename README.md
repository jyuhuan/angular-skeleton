# Angular Skeleton
Starter code (in the style of maven) for Angular apps. 

## Features

- Separation of TypeScript (`*.ts`) files and the transpiled JavaScript (`*.js`) files, resulting in a clutter free `src/` folder.
- Automatic detection and copying of `*.html`, `*.css` files in the `src/` folder to the target folder.
